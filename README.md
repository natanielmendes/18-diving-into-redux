# 18-diving-into-redux + @redux-toolkit

### Project for diving into different redux concepts and exploring its features in react-redux, especially @redux-toolkit

There are experiments in this project involving:
- Dispatching asynchronous actions
- Manipulating redux states
- Using states as flags for all different asynchronous thunk states 
- Dispatching actions to reset flags from target components
- Managing redux store in separate files

To execute this project, run the following `npm` commands in a terminal:

`npm install`

`npm start`
